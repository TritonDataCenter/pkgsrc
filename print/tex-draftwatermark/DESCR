The package provides a means to add a watermark (typically a
light gray piece of text) on every page or on the first page of
a document. Typical usage may consist in writing words such as
DRAFT or CONFIDENTIAL across document pages. The package
performs a similar function to that of draftcopy, but its
implementation is output device independent. As of December
2020, the package relies on the new shipout hooks directly
provided by LaTeX. For users of older versions of LaTeX, the
package also provides a legacy version of itself (that is
automatically loaded, currently being at release 2.3) which
relies on the everypage package. Note that this legacy version
will progressively lag behind in terms of features.
