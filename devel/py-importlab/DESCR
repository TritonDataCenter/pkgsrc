Importlab is a library for Python that automatically infers
dependencies and calculates a dependency graph. It can perform
dependency ordering of a set of files, including cycle detection.

Importlab's main use case is to work with static analysis tools
that process one file at a time, ensuring that a file's dependencies
are analysed before it is.
