bacon is a background rust code checker.

It's designed for minimal interaction so that you can just let it run,
alongside your editor, and be notified of warnings, errors, or test failures
in your Rust code.

It conveys the information you need even in a small terminal so that you can
keep more screen estate for your other tasks.

It shows you errors before warnings, and the first errors before the last ones,
so you don't have to scroll up to find what's relevant.
