Perl module to manage entropy sources.

This distribution includes modules relating to sources and use of entropy.
They all interoperate, but can also be used independently.

The Data::Entropy module maintains a concept of a current selection
of entropy source.  Algorithms that require entropy, such as those in
Data::Entropy::Algorithms, can use the source nominated by this module,
avoiding the need for entropy source objects to be explicitly passed
around.  This is convenient because usually one entropy source will
be used for an entire program run and so an explicit entropy source
parameter would rarely vary.  There is also a default entropy source,
avoiding the need to explicitly configure a source at all.
