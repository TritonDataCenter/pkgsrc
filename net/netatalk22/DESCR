Netatalk is a freely-available, kernel level implementation of the
AppleTalk Protocol Suite, originally for BSD-derived systems.

A *NIX/*BSD system running Netatalk is capable of serving many
Macintosh clients simultaneously as an AppleTalk router, AppleShare
file server (AFP), *NIX/*BSD print server, and for accessing AppleTalk
printers via Printer Access Protocol (PAP).  Included are a number of
minor printing and debugging utilities.

This package contains the 2.x branch of Netatalk, which has ddp-based
AppleTalk protocol support for pre-Darwin Mac systems ("Traditional
Mac OS" in Apple parlance).  It exists because that support was
removed in Netatalk 3.
