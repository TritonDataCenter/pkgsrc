GNU moe is a console text editor for ISO-8859 and ASCII character encodings.
It has a modeless, user-friendly interface, online help, multiple windows,
global search/replace (on all buffers at once), block operations, automatic
indentation, word wrapping, file name completion, directory browser, duplicate
removal from prompt histories, delimiter matching, text conversion from/to
UTF-8, romanization, etc. The file size, line length, number of buffers,
and undo/redo capability are only limited by the amount of memory available
and the size of the address space of your machine.

Moe respects your work. By default it won't automatically add, change, or
remove a single byte in your files. Moe is a WYTIWYG (what you type is what
you get) editor.

Moe can easily edit thousands of files at the same time.
